## Week 1: Shared User Access Model for Site Teams

### Hook

Is your team’s HubSpot access model giving you the visibility you need—without breaking the bank?

### Proof

Many property operators default to a single shared login, but that often leads to confusion and lost accountability. On the other hand, giving every staff member a full licence can get expensive fast. There’s a smarter way.

### System Walkthrough

Let’s look at your options for user accounts in HubSpot:

#### Option 1: Named User Logins (1 per person)

- Highest accountability and tracking, but higher cost and more admin.

#### Option 2: Team/Shared Logins (e.g., 1 per building or site)

- Lower cost, but you lose clarity on who’s doing what.

#### Option 3: Shared Login + View-Only Named Users

- This is the Cloudfox recommendation for most property teams.
- Here’s how it works:
  - Use a shared login for each site or team to handle all edits, emails, and deal management.
  - Add view-only named users for each staff member. These are free in HubSpot and can be assigned tasks or included in workflows.
  - You still get visibility—tasks and assignments are tracked to individuals, even though edits are made by the shared account.
- **Pros:** You maintain accountability and audit trails for key actions, without the cost of a full licence for every user.
- **Cons:** Staff need to know when to use the shared login versus their view-only account, and offboarding still needs to be managed.

### Additional Considerations

- If you use shared mailboxes, your IT provider must enable login with a password—check Microsoft licensing before proceeding.
- HubSpot inboxes: a shared inbox can’t be connected to both a calendar and inbox at the same time, so plan your meeting scheduling accordingly.
- Only Sales Pro users (the shared login) can send sequences, use templates, or be included in ownership rotation. View-only accounts are for visibility and task assignment.

### Hero Example

A property operator with four regions switched to this model: one shared login per site for all edits, plus view-only accounts for each staff member. They kept costs down, but could still assign tasks and track who was responsible for what. When a deal needed follow-up, it was clear who was on point—even though the shared login handled the day-to-day updates.

### Lessons and Pitfalls

- Don’t rely solely on a single shared login—add view-only users for every staff member to keep your workflow transparent.
- Make sure your team understands which account to use for each task.
- Always check with IT before enabling shared mailbox logins to avoid licensing issues.

### Best Practice Recommendation

Cloudfox recommends a shared team login for each site or team, with view-only named users for all staff. This gives you the best balance of cost, accountability, and visibility.
