## Slide 1: Title

**Text:**
Growth Engine Onboarding: Shared User Access Model for Site Teams

**Speaker Notes:**
Welcome to the Growth Engine onboarding series. Today, we’re focusing on how to set up user access in HubSpot for your site teams—balancing visibility, accountability, and cost.

---

## Slide 2: Hook

**Text:**
Is your team’s HubSpot access model giving you the visibility you need—without breaking the bank?

**Speaker Notes:**
Let’s start with a question: Is your current setup helping you see who’s doing what, or is it creating confusion and hidden costs?

---

## Slide 3: The Problem

**Text:**

- Many operators use a single shared login.
- Leads to confusion and lost accountability.
- Full licences for everyone = expensive.

**Speaker Notes:**
Most property teams default to a shared login. It seems simple, but it makes it hard to track activity and can cause issues if something goes wrong. On the flip side, giving everyone a full licence can get expensive quickly.

---

## Slide 4: There’s a Smarter Way

**Text:**
Cloudfox recommends: Shared login + view-only users.

**Speaker Notes:**
There’s a better approach that gives you the best of both worlds—clarity and cost control.

---

## Slide 5: User Account Options

**Text:**
- Option 1: Named User Logins (1 per person)
- Option 2: Team/Shared Logins (1 per building/site)
- Option 3: Shared Login + View-Only Named Users (Recommended)

**Speaker Notes:**
Let’s break down your options. Each has pros and cons, but only one really fits most property teams.

---

## Slide 6: How the Cloudfox Model Works

**Text:**
- Shared login for edits, emails, deal management.
- View-only named users (free) for each staff member.
- Assign tasks, include in workflows, track accountability.

**Speaker Notes:**
With this model, your main team actions are done through a shared login, but every staff member has a view-only account. This means you can assign tasks and keep everyone in the loop—without extra licence costs.

---

## Slide 7: Pros & Cons

**Text:**
- Pros: Accountability, audit trails, lower cost.
- Cons: Staff must know which account to use, manage offboarding.

**Speaker Notes:**
You get the benefits of tracking and accountability, but you’ll need to train your team on which account to use for what, and keep your user list up to date.

---

## Slide 8: Additional Considerations

**Text:**
- Shared mailboxes: IT must enable login (check licensing).
- HubSpot inboxes: Shared inbox can’t connect to both calendar and inbox.
- Only Sales Pro users (shared login) can send sequences, use templates.

**Speaker Notes:**
A few technical notes: check with IT before enabling shared mailbox logins, and remember the limitations of shared inboxes in HubSpot.

---

## Slide 9: Real-World Example

**Text:**
Operator with 4 regions: Switched to shared login + view-only users. Kept costs down, could assign tasks, track responsibility.

**Speaker Notes:**
Here’s a real example: a property operator with four regions made the switch and saw immediate benefits in cost and clarity.

---

## Slide 10: Lessons & Pitfalls

**Text:**

- Don’t rely only on a shared login—add view-only users.
- Make sure team knows which account to use.
- Always check with IT before enabling shared mailbox logins.

**Speaker Notes:**
The key lessons: always add view-only users, train your team, and check with IT before making changes to mailbox logins.

---

## Slide 11: Best Practice Recommendation

**Text:**

- Shared team login for each site/team.
- View-only named users for all staff.
- Best balance of cost, accountability, and visibility.

**Speaker Notes:**
Cloudfox’s best practice: shared logins for main actions, view-only users for everyone else. This is the most efficient and transparent setup.
